# WGNEPS

## Introduction

This is the code repository for [The Working Group on Nephrops Surveys (WGNEPS)](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGNEPS.aspx), which is the international coordination group for _Nephrops_ UWTV and trawl surveys within ICES. For underwater television surveys (UWTV), this group builds on the work of WKNEPHTV 2007, WKNEPHBID 2010, SGNEPS 2009, 2010 & 2012, WKNEPH 2009 and WKNEPS 2016 & 2018.

This repository includes input files, R scripts and additional functions needed to run the code.
This repository does not include output files, as stated in _.gitignore_. However, output files could be uploaded in the future.
