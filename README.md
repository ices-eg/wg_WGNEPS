# WGNEPS

## Introduction

This is the code repository for [The Working Group on Nephrops Surveys (WGNEPS)](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGNEPS.aspx), which is the international coordination group for _Nephrops_ UWTV and trawl surveys within ICES.

For underwater television surveys (UWTV), this group builds on the work of WKNEPHTV 2007, WKNEPHBID 2010, SGNEPS 2009, 2010 & 2012, WKNEPH 2009 and WKNEPS 2018. The group will also review the results and protocols in place for various _Nephrops_ trawl surveys existing within ICES.
